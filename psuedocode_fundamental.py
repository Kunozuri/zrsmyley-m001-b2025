    --- ENTRY  CONFLUENCE
        LOOK FOR singe candle orderblock in low interval
        CHECK IF low interval bollinger bands derivation tapped



TP AND SL MANAGEMENT
    --- STOPLOSS
        SET SL below the tapped zone
        IF zone get pierced:
            SET SL below the current low
        
    --- TAKE PROFIT
        IF entry from desicional or extreme:
            SET TP to high interval bos
        
        IF entry from opposite direction of high interval:
            SET TP to low interval bos
    
    --- TRAIL STOP
        SET trail stop to lower low



RISK MANAGEMENT: 1000$
    --- 0.5% RISK
        IF opposite direction from high interval
        IF confluenced of one of the trend channel or SNR
        
    --- 1% RISK
        IF the same direction as high interval
        IF confluenced of one of the trend channel or SNR
        
    --- 2% RISK
        IF confluenced of both of the trend channel and SNR
